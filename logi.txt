LINE 143:  length is 24,  strings_adressed[1394].adress is: Ham. Denmark's a prison. 
LINE 143:  length is 27,  strings_adressed[1395].adress is: Ros. Then is the world one. 
LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[1396].adress is: Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and 
LINE 143:  length is 41,  strings_adressed[1397].adress is: dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.

LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[1401].adress is: Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your

LINE 143:  length is 36,  strings_adressed[1407].adress is: Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.

LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[1420].adress is: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were

LINE 143:  length is 34,  strings_adressed[1423].adress is: Guil. What should we say, my lord? 
LINE 143:  length is 62,  strings_adressed[1424].adress is: Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and

LINE 143:  length is 65,  strings_adressed[1429].adress is: Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights 
LINE 143:  length is 57,  strings_adressed[1430].adress is: of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the

LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3845].adress is: great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card

LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[3863].adress is: Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are

LINE 143:  length is 56,  strings_adressed[3869].adress is: Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is- 
LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[3870].adress is: Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in 
LINE 143:  length is 56,  strings_adressed[3871].adress is: excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself. 
LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[3872].adress is: Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him

LINE 143:  length is 21,  strings_adressed[3882].adress is: very liberal conceit. 
LINE 143:  length is 33,  strings_adressed[3883].adress is: Ham. What call you the carriages? 
LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3884].adress is: Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent 
LINE 143:  length is 17,  strings_adressed[3885].adress is: ere you had done. 
LINE 143:  length is 41,  strings_adressed[3886].adress is: Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers. 
LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[3887].adress is: Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could 
LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[3888].adress is: carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.   
LINE 143:  length is 59,  strings_adressed[3889].adress is: But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their 
LINE 143:  length is 65,  strings_adressed[3890].adress is: assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French 
LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3891].adress is: bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it? 
LINE 143:  length is 61,  strings_adressed[3892].adress is: Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between 
LINE 143:  length is 61,  strings_adressed[3893].adress is: yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath 
LINE 143:  length is 61,  strings_adressed[3894].adress is: laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial

LINE 143:  length is 40,  strings_adressed[3905].adress is: Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship. 
LINE 143:  length is 59,  strings_adressed[3906].adress is: Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it 
LINE 143:  length is 46,  strings_adressed[3907].adress is: himself; there are no tongues else for's turn. 
LINE 143:  length is 57,  strings_adressed[3908].adress is: Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.   
LINE 143:  length is 65,  strings_adressed[3909].adress is: Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he, 
LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[3910].adress is: and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes

LINE 143:  length is 13,  strings_adressed[3915].adress is: Enter a Lord. 
LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[3916].adress is: Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who

LINE 143:  length is 17,  strings_adressed[3919].adress is: take longer time. 
LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[3920].adress is: Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.

LINE 143:  length is 20,  strings_adressed[3922].adress is: I be so able as now. 
LINE 143:  length is 49,  strings_adressed[3923].adress is: Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down. 
LINE 143:  length is 19,  strings_adressed[3924].adress is: Ham. In happy time. 
LINE 143:  length is 63,  strings_adressed[3925].adress is: Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to

LINE 143:  length is 27,  strings_adressed[3927].adress is: Ham. She well instructs me. 
LINE 143:  length is 11,  strings_adressed[3928].adress is: Exit Lord.] 
LINE 143:  length is 39,  strings_adressed[3929].adress is: Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord. 
LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3930].adress is: Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in 
LINE 143:  length is 65,  strings_adressed[3931].adress is: continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not 
LINE 143:  length is 61,  strings_adressed[3932].adress is: think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter. 
LINE 143:  length is 24,  strings_adressed[3933].adress is: Hor. Nay, good my lord - 
LINE 143:  length is 62,  strings_adressed[3934].adress is: Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as 
LINE 143:  length is 30,  strings_adressed[3935].adress is: would perhaps trouble a woman. 
LINE 143:  length is 67,  strings_adressed[3936].adress is: Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their

LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3938].adress is: Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in 
LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3939].adress is: the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be 
LINE 143:  length is 64,  strings_adressed[3940].adress is: not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: 
LINE 143:  length is 65,  strings_adressed[3941].adress is: the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves, 
LINE 143:  length is 35,  strings_adressed[3942].adress is: what is't to leave betimes? Let be. 
LINE 143:  length is 56,  strings_adressed[3943].adress is: Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other

LINE 143:  length is 53,  strings_adressed[3948].adress is: Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; 
LINE 143:  length is 37,  strings_adressed[3949].adress is: But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. 
LINE 143:  length is 20,  strings_adressed[3950].adress is: This presence knows, 
LINE 143:  length is 48,  strings_adressed[3951].adress is: And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd 
LINE 143:  length is 39,  strings_adressed[3952].adress is: With sore distraction. What I have done 
LINE 143:  length is 45,  strings_adressed[3953].adress is: That might your nature, honour, and exception

LINE 143:  length is 43,  strings_adressed[3955].adress is: Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet. 
LINE 143:  length is 37,  strings_adressed[3956].adress is: If Hamlet from himself be taken away, 
LINE 143:  length is 45,  strings_adressed[3957].adress is: And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, 
LINE 143:  length is 42,  strings_adressed[3958].adress is: Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. 
LINE 143:  length is 43,  strings_adressed[3959].adress is: Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so, 
LINE 143:  length is 41,  strings_adressed[3960].adress is: Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; 
LINE 143:  length is 35,  strings_adressed[3961].adress is: His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. 
LINE 143:  length is 22,  strings_adressed[3962].adress is: Sir, in this audience, 
LINE 143:  length is 39,  strings_adressed[3963].adress is: Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil

LINE 143:  length is 40,  strings_adressed[3965].adress is: That I have shot my arrow o'er the house 
LINE 143:  length is 20,  strings_adressed[3966].adress is: And hurt my brother. 
LINE 143:  length is 31,  strings_adressed[3967].adress is: Laer. I am satisfied in nature,

LINE 143:  length is 40,  strings_adressed[3969].adress is: To my revenge. But in my terms of honour 
LINE 143:  length is 40,  strings_adressed[3970].adress is: I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement 
LINE 143:  length is 42,  strings_adressed[3971].adress is: Till by some elder masters of known honour 
LINE 143:  length is 37,  strings_adressed[3972].adress is: I have a voice and precedent of peace 
LINE 143:  length is 43,  strings_adressed[3973].adress is: To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time 
LINE 143:  length is 41,  strings_adressed[3974].adress is: I do receive your offer'd love like love, 
LINE 143:  length is 22,  strings_adressed[3975].adress is: And will not wrong it. 
LINE 143:  length is 25,  strings_adressed[3976].adress is: Ham. I embrace it freely, 
LINE 143:  length is 43,  strings_adressed[3977].adress is: And will this brother's wager frankly play. 
LINE 143:  length is 27,  strings_adressed[3978].adress is: Give us the foils. Come on. 
LINE 143:  length is 23,  strings_adressed[3979].adress is: Laer. Come, one for me. 
LINE 143:  length is 50,  strings_adressed[3980].adress is: Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance 
LINE 143:  length is 51,  strings_adressed[3981].adress is: Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night, 
LINE 143:  length is 23,  strings_adressed[3982].adress is: Stick fiery off indeed. 
LINE 143:  length is 23,  strings_adressed[3983].adress is: Laer. You mock me, sir. 
LINE 143:  length is 23,  strings_adressed[3984].adress is: Ham. No, by this bad.   
LINE 143:  length is 54,  strings_adressed[3985].adress is: King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

LINE 143:  length is 48,  strings_adressed[3988].adress is: Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side. 
LINE 143:  length is 45,  strings_adressed[3989].adress is: King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both; 
LINE 143:  length is 49,  strings_adressed[3990].adress is: But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds. 
LINE 143:  length is 44,  strings_adressed[3991].adress is: Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another. 
LINE 143:  length is 55,  strings_adressed[3992].adress is: Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length? 
LINE 143:  length is 16,  strings_adressed[3993].adress is: Prepare to play.
